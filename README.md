This is a secure password access control circuit with LCD. 
It works on the principle of matching the entered bits of data with the pre-set bits acting as a secure password. 
The default password is set as “1234” and can be changed to meet users needs. 
Once the correct sequence of bits is entered, the vault unlocks. 
However by pressing the “*” button, we can lock it again. 
I have also added a mechanism to change passwords
